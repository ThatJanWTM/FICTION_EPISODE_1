sometimes i think about how different our lives would have been if were different



well, you'd think with limitless worlds that we would find one where we're different people



i know, it's just that it feels like in a world full of infinite copies of infinite people, only having one possible outcome for someone like me feels somewhat lonely.



as much as i appreciate that, it still doesn't get rid of the feeling



it's ok, you trying to help is making it feel less lonely.
